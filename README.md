## About the Project
This project uses Python ```Socket Programming```. ```REST APIs``` are used to communicate with the server. The server receives the ```HTTP``` requests and responds by sending back the appropriate data that was asked in the request. ```AJAX``` is also used in this project to prevent reloading the page again and again after each request. 

## How to Run
Download all the files. First run the web_server.py file, either using an IDE or terminal. 
To run using the terminal, first make sure you are in the directory where all the files for the project are and then use the command:

```python web_server.py```

Once it is running, open your browser (example: Google Chrome) and type:

```localhost:8080/index.html```

This would run it locally.
